Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic and rapidly advancing areas of AI in healthcare. There have been significant breakthroughs and ongoing developments. Here are some of the latest trends and specific examples:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** Instead of screening existing libraries of compounds, generative AI models (like GANs and VAEs) can now *design* entirely new molecules from scratch that are optimized for specific properties. This means they can create molecules predicted to bind to a target protein, have desirable pharmacokinetic profiles (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes a drug), and be synthesizable.\n*   **Examples:** Companies like **Exscientia**, **Insilico Medicine**, and **Recursion Pharmaceuticals** are heavily leveraging generative AI for this. Exscientia famously used AI to design an experimental drug for obsessive-compulsive disorder that entered clinical trials in record time. Insilico Medicine has also announced promising preclinical candidates discovered through their AI platform.\n\n**2. AI for Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Uncovering Novel Targets:** AI can analyze vast amounts of biological data – genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, clinical data – to identify previously unknown disease targets (e.g., specific proteins or pathways involved in a disease).\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI helps assess whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable,\" meaning it can be modulated by a small molecule or biologic drug.\n*   **Examples:** **Relay Therapeutics** uses AI to understand protein motion and identify novel therapeutic targets. **Schrödinger** uses physics-based modeling and AI to accelerate target identification and drug design.\n\n**3. AI in Clinical Trial Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Predicting Patient Response:** AI can analyze patient data to predict who is most likely to respond to a particular drug, allowing for more precise patient selection in clinical trials. This can lead to smaller, faster, and more successful trials.\n*   **Identifying Biomarkers:** AI can help discover biomarkers that indicate disease progression or treatment response, which are crucial for monitoring drug efficacy.\n*   **Simulating Trial Outcomes:** AI can be used to build digital twins or simulate aspects of clinical trials before they begin, helping to optimize protocols and identify potential issues.\n\n**4. AI for Drug Repurposing:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI can analyze existing drug databases, scientific literature, and patient data to identify approved drugs that might be effective for new diseases. This significantly reduces the time and cost compared to developing a new drug from scratch.\n*   **Examples:** Many companies and academic groups are using AI for this, especially in areas like rare diseases or during public health crises.\n\n**5. Advancements in Protein Folding and Structure Prediction:**\n\n*   **Understanding Drug-Target Interactions:** AI models like **AlphaFold** (from DeepMind) have revolutionized protein structure prediction. Knowing the precise 3D structure of a target protein is fundamental to designing drugs that can bind to it effectively.\n*   **Rational Drug Design:** This accurate structural information allows for more rational and targeted drug design, improving the chances of success.\n\n**6. AI in Identifying and Mitigating Drug Toxicity:**\n\n*   **Predicting Adverse Events:** AI can analyze molecular structures and biological data to predict potential toxicity or off-target effects of drug candidates early in the development process, saving resources and preventing harm.\n\n**Key Players and Trends to Watch:**\n\n*   **Biotech Startups:** A wave of AI-native biotech startups are emerging, focusing on specific aspects of the drug discovery pipeline.\n*   **Big Pharma Collaborations:** Major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly partnering with or acquiring AI drug discovery companies to integrate these technologies into their R&D.\n*   **Data Integration:** The ability to effectively integrate diverse biological and clinical datasets is crucial for AI success in drug discovery.\n*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** As AI becomes more integral, there's a growing need for \"explainable AI\" so researchers can understand *why* an AI model makes a particular prediction, fostering trust and facilitating scientific validation.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just incrementally improving drug discovery; it's fundamentally reshaping it, making the process faster, cheaper, and more likely to succeed in bringing novel and effective treatments to patients.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **AI for Target Identification and Validation.** This is a crucial bottleneck in the traditional drug discovery process, and AI is having a significant impact here.\n\nLet's break down what this means and why it's so important:\n\n**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n\nA drug target is typically a molecule in the body that a drug is designed to interact with to produce a therapeutic effect. Most often, these targets are:\n\n*   **Proteins:** Enzymes, receptors, ion channels, structural proteins, etc.\n*   **Nucleic Acids:** DNA or RNA (though less common for small molecule drugs).\n\nFor a drug to be effective, it needs to interact with the *right* target that is causally involved in a disease process.\n\n**The Traditional Challenge of Target Identification:**\n\nHistorically, identifying new drug targets has been a long, arduous, and often serendipitous process. It involved:\n\n*   **Extensive Basic Research:** Scientists painstakingly studying disease mechanisms, trying to understand what goes wrong at a molecular level.\n*   **Hypothesis-Driven Research:** Forming hypotheses about potential targets based on limited observations.\n*   **Lots of Trial and Error:** Investigating many potential targets, most of which don't pan out.\n*   **Limited Data Integration:** Difficulty in synthesizing insights from vastly different types of biological data (e.g., genetic studies, protein expression data, cell behavior).\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding patterns and making predictions from massive, complex datasets. Here's how it's applied:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Omics Data (Genomics, Proteomics, Transcriptomics):**\n    *   **What it is:** AI can process vast amounts of genetic sequencing data, protein expression levels, and RNA activity from healthy individuals and those with specific diseases.\n    *   **How AI helps:** It can identify genes or proteins that are consistently over- or under-expressed in disease states, or mutations that are strongly correlated with a disease. These can then be considered potential targets.\n    *   **Example:** AI could sift through genomic data from thousands of cancer patients to identify a specific gene mutation that is prevalent only in aggressive forms of a cancer, suggesting its protein product might be a good target for a new therapy.\n\n2.  **Integrating Multi-Modal Data:**\n    *   **What it is:** Diseases are complex and involve interactions between many biological systems. AI can integrate data from various sources – patient electronic health records (EHRs), imaging data, molecular profiles, scientific literature, and even real-world evidence from wearable devices.\n    *   **How AI helps:** By connecting these disparate data points, AI can reveal subtle relationships and causal links that would be missed by human analysis alone, leading to the identification of novel targets or pathways.\n\n3.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n    *   **What it is:** Not all potential disease-associated molecules are good drug targets. A target needs to have a \"binding pocket\" where a drug can attach, and modulating it should ideally have a beneficial effect without causing too many side effects.\n    *   **How AI helps:** AI models can analyze the structural and functional properties of proteins to predict how likely they are to be successfully targeted by a drug. This helps prioritize which potential targets are worth pursuing, saving resources.\n\n4.  **Validating Targets:**\n    *   **What it is:** Once a potential target is identified, it needs to be \"validated\" – meaning experimental evidence must confirm that modulating this target actually has a therapeutic effect.\n    *   **How AI helps:** AI can design more informed experiments, analyze the results of those experiments more efficiently, and even simulate the effect of modulating a target in a virtual environment before costly wet-lab experiments begin.\n\n**Key Companies and Initiatives:**\n\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** They use an \"adrenergic\" approach, combining high-throughput cellular imaging with machine learning to identify disease-causing biology and potential targets.\n*   **BenevolentAI:** This company uses its AI platform to mine vast amounts of scientific literature and data to discover novel drug targets and design new drugs.\n*   **Relay Therapeutics:** Focuses on understanding protein motion and dynamics, using AI to identify novel therapeutic targets based on these insights.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its end-to-end AI platform, which includes target identification as a core component.\n\n**The Impact:**\n\nBy accelerating target identification and improving validation, AI helps to:\n\n*   **Reduce the Time and Cost:** What used to take years and millions of dollars can potentially be done much faster.\n*   **Increase the Success Rate:** By focusing on more promising and validated targets, the likelihood of a drug candidate eventually succeeding increases.\n*   **Uncover Novel Biology:** AI can reveal entirely new disease mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities that were previously hidden.\n\nThis development is foundational because a faulty or unvalidated target is the root cause of many drug development failures. AI is providing a more systematic, data-driven, and efficient way to find the right \"keys\" (drugs) for the right \"locks\" (targets) in the complex machinery of our bodies.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the main companies involved in AI-driven **target identification and validation** in drug discovery.

Big Pharma Companies with Strong AI Initiatives:**\n\nMajor pharmaceutical companies are investing heavily in AI, either through internal R&D, acquisitions, or strategic partnerships. They often focus on applying AI to their existing knowledge base and vast internal datasets.\n\n*   **Pfizer:** Has been actively pursuing AI in R&D, including for target identification and early discovery.\n*   **Novartis:** Has publicly discussed its commitment to AI and is using it across various stages of drug development.\n*   **Roche:** Is a significant player in genomics and diagnostics, and is leveraging AI to connect these insights with target identification.\n*   **GSK (GlaxoSmithKline):** Has a dedicated AI research unit and collaborates with AI companies to advance drug discovery.\n*   **AstraZeneca:** Is investing in AI and machine learning to accelerate R&D, including target identification and validation.\n*   **Merck:** Is also exploring AI applications to enhance its drug discovery efforts.\n\n**3. Companies with Specialized AI Approaches:**\n\nSome companies focus on specific aspects of AI or data that are critical for target identification.\n\n*   **Relay Therapeutics:** While focused on protein dynamics, understanding protein behavior is fundamental to identifying and validating targets that are involved in disease pathways. Their AI-driven approach to protein motion analysis directly aids in this.\n*   **Eversana:** While often known for commercialization services, they also use data analytics and AI to identify unmet needs and potential therapeutic areas, which can indirectly lead to target identification.\n*   **Freenome:** Primarily focused on early cancer detection using AI and multi-omics, their understanding of disease signatures at a molecular level can inform target identification for therapeutic interventions.\n\n**Key Trends in Partnerships:**\n\nYou'll see a lot of:\n\n*   **Big Pharma partnering with AI-native biotechs:** This allows big pharma to access cutting-edge AI technology and platforms, while the AI companies get access to significant funding, biological expertise, and clinical trial infrastructure.\n*   **Acquisitions:** As AI drug discovery proves its value, larger companies are acquiring successful AI startups.\n\nIt's important to note that this list is not exhaustive, and the landscape is constantly changing with new players emerging and existing ones evolving. Many academic institutions are also doing groundbreaking work in AI for target identification, which often spurs the creation of new companies.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.3 Verifying Compaction in the Session History\n\nThe conversation above looks normal, but the history has been changed behind the scenes.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
